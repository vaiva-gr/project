# Project

Explicit Requirements
● Create a server explorer web app:
(Implement login (POST http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/tokens { username: "tesonet", password: "partyanimal" });
Display servers list - GET http://playground.tesonet.lt/v1/servers;
Make servers list sortable by name / distance)
● App must work on all modern browsers + IE11

Implicit Requirements
● App must be production ready - (functionality, performance, error handling etc.)
● There is no design provided but make it visually appealing.

Other expectations
● Use React + Redux (or context)
● Don't import too many libraries (keep away from bootstrap, material-ui etc.)
● Utility libraries like lodash, tailwindcss etc. are fine
● create-react-app is fine for entry/mid level positions
● We like tests
